  <summary>First cipher solutions</summary>
  
 The scratched numbers on the table's centerpiece are the keys for the two Caesar ciphers, which when solved, reward you with the keys for the two Vigenère ciphers. This can be deduced by the scratches under the numbers and under certain words on the cards. Both Caesar ciphers are on cards with images related to a relevant family's crest.
  
  The cipher on the Tomasi di Lampedusa family crest is slightly more obfuscated by using the Italian alphabet instead of the English one (21 chars instead of 26). It translates to "Ill gattopardo", and "gattopardo" is the important word here for the later Vigenère cipher.
  
  The second Caesar cipher (key 5) solves to "What else has the Crescent paid for?" and the underlined word is Crescent.

# The Sicilian Report

This is an open-source game being developed under the design philosophy of The Snowfield - instead of massive content generation, segments of gameplay are added and fine-tuned based on the interactions observed from early testers, in an "inversion of the traditional relationship between Design and QA to create a highly improvisational game world".

**Controls**
